description: "I don't quite remember the theme of this essay, but I think it had to do with mystery, suspense, or even horror. My interpretation of this was to capture a man living a mundane, unfulfilling life, who then suddenly finds himself stuck in it in an extreme way: reliving the same day over and over."
